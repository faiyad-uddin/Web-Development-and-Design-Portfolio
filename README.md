**This repository showcases a collection of web development and web design projects. It includes examples of responsive websites, UI/UX designs, and front-end development work, demonstrating skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and design tools like Figma and Adobe XD. These projects cover a variety of use cases, from simple landing pages to complex, interactive web applications.**

**Technologies Used**

- HTML5: Markup language for structuring content on the web.

- CSS3: Styling language used for layout, colors, typography, and design.

- JavaScript: For adding interactivity and dynamic features to websites.

- Figma: For designing and prototyping web and mobile interfaces.

- Adobe XD: Used for UI/UX design and prototyping.

- Bootstrap: Front-end framework for developing responsive websites quickly.

- React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.

- Node.js: For server-side JavaScript, enabling back-end development.

- MongoDB: Database used for storing user data in some projects (if applicable).

- WordPress: Content management system (CMS) for building custom websites with easy content editing.

**Setup / Usage**

**Explore the Projects:**

Each project is contained in its respective folder. For example, a landing page project might be in the landing-page/ folder, and a React.js web app might be in the react-app/ folder.

Inside each folder, you'll find the project's code along with a README file explaining the setup and functionality.

**Customize and Build:**

Use Visual Studio Code or any code editor to open and modify the projects.

For React.js projects, you’ll need to run npm install to install dependencies and then run the app locally using npm start.

For WordPress-based projects, you can set them up on a local server (using XAMPP or MAMP) to view and edit the website.

**Deploy the Website:**
Once you've made changes or completed the design, you can deploy your website to platforms like:

GitHub Pages for static websites.

Netlify or Vercel for front-end frameworks (React, Vue, etc.).

Heroku for full-stack applications.

WordPress Hosting (like SiteGround or Bluehost) for WordPress sites.
